      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <h4>Automation</h4>
      <p>I have experience automating end to end flows using cypress.More recently I have been using playwright which I have found to be my preference over cypress, desipte a slightly steeper learning curve I find its speed and browser breadth hard to ignore. For mobile I have some minor experience in, it was not something I had spent a lot of time focusing on but my company decided to pickup maestro and I was able to automate some simple navigation flows of applications.</a></p>
      <h4>Manual Testing</h4>
      <p>My first job was only manual for the first few years where I gained a good understanding of the core foundations of testing. Not just following acceptance criteria but coming up with potential user flows to provide the team with an understanding on how the system may work under different conditions. along side this I continually gained an appreciation for good documentation which is a skill I continue to grow.</a></p>
